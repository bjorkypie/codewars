<h3>What is Codewars?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a> is a site with tons of coding challenges for new and seasoned developers. These challenges, or 'kata', vary in difficulty and span many concepts. A problem might focus on programming fundamentals, real life issues, or complex creative problem solving. While there are dozens of languages to practice in, I'm currently learning JavaScript. In the future, I plan to add Python, Ruby, and SQL to my asrenal. What's cool is that the challenges are available across languages - they can be revisited and solved again in the new language you're practicing!</p>
